    "The ATIS (Airline Travel Information Systems) dataset consists of English language queries for booking (or requesting information about) flights in the US. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each word in a query (i.e. a request by a user) is labelled according to its **entity-type**, for e.g. in the query 'please show morning flights from chicago to new york', 'chicago' and 'new york are labelled as 'source' and 'destination' locations respectively while 'morning' is labelled as 'time-of-day' (the exact labelling scheme is a bit different, more on that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some example queries taken from the dataset are shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "'what flights leave atlanta at about DIGIT in the afternoon and arrive in san francisco',\n",
    " 'what is the abbreviation for canadian airlines international',\n",
    " \"i 'd like to know the earliest flight from boston to atlanta\",\n",
    " 'show me the us air flights from atlanta to boston',\n",

    " \"i 'd like to see all flights from denver to philadelphia\"\n",
    " }\n",
    " ```\n",

    "### Objective\n",
    "Our objective is to **build an information extraction system** which can extract entities relevant for booking flights (such as source and destination cities, time, date, budget constraints etc.) in a **structured format** from a given user-generated query.\n",
    "\n",
